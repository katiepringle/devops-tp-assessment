# TravelPerk devops assessment 

Steps Taken:
1. Create Repo and copy existing one from TravelPerk.
2. Set Require status checks to pass before merging on `main` branch in Repository Branch Settings.
3. Create Dockerfile - creates a lightweight Docker image for a Python Flask application, installs the necessary dependencies, and runs the application in a way that makes it accessible from outside the container.
